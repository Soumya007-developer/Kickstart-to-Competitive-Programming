## Contributing Guidelines

### Principle
The guiding principle for this list is to connect more people to actual information regarding the testing pattern of major companies for SWE Internships.  


Please just note that this is a **curated** list which means it's not a complete catalogue of everything.

### TODOs
1. Better descriptions
2. More great resources from other regions
3. Social media around programming competitions (eg. ACM-ICPC, Google Code-In, Codechef Long Challenges,USACO)
4. A short reference sheet
5. Anything you can think of to make it more comprehensive for all kinds of audience.

### Submission
1. For new items or modifications, submit a pull request here ([learn how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)).
2. For dead links or suggestions, [create an issue](https://github.com/Soumya007-developer/Kickstart-to-Competitive-Programming/issues/new).


### Rules
1. Please do not submit confidential resources (eg. handouts from closed training camps).
2. To add a new item or make modifications to the list, make sure you state your reasons with proper justification.
3. In this repository, I am targeting mainly concepts and problems that are frequently asked by top investment banking firms or FAANG Companies , so make sure not to deviate to topics that are out of it's scope.
