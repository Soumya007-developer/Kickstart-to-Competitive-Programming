## What we will cover?
1. Introduction to why algorithms are important and why they are important part in all major contests worldwide.
2. Big-O, Big-theta, Big-Ohmega Notations this includes time complexity and space complexity and also way to avoid tle error in program
3. Problem format
    - Problem statement
    - Input
    - Output
    - Estimating if a problem will run on our coding style
    - Estimated complexity we require to build solution
4. The approach for problem solving will strictly follow the following order:
